Welcome to "What I Learned in Intro to Web Development"

<body>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
<p style="background-color:yellow;">
To start things off, creating and stylizing a paragraph. The background has been colored yellow using inline CSS. The line of the background seems to extend far beyond where the text stops but at this point in time I have no clue how to fix that. So oh well. The heading above this has been colored red using Internal CSS. If I had to keep listing things I don't know how to do yet, changing the size of the text (header or paragraph) is definitely one of them. Additionally, the text of the body has been alligned to the center using External CSS. The font size and font style of the paragraph, along with the font style of the header, were also changed, and this was all done using Internal CSS.

<div class="Div1">
	<h2>The Div Elements</h2>
	<p>I learned how to create and stylize div elements, and stylized them identically.</p>
</div>
<div class="Div2">
	<h2>Keeping them Inline</h2>
	<p>Using the inline-grid code, I learned how to keep the div elements all on the same line</p>
</div>
<div class="Div3">
	<h2>The Other One</h2>
	<p>I wanted 3 div elements but ran out of things to say so this one is different looking.</p>
</div>
<h4>Let's see what critics have to say!</h4>

<h5>So There You Have It Folks!</h5>
<p style="background-color: lightblue">I hope you've enjoyed the brief tour of my little website. Coding is not my first language but I'd like to think that over the course of this class I've learned a thing or two and have been able to put together a somewhat presentable page for your viewing pleasure. Oh, and I do have one last treat for you.</p>
