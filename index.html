This is my example paragraph. The background has been colored yellow using inline CSS. The line of the background seems to extend far beyond where the text stops but at this point in time I have no clue how to fix that. So oh well. The heading above this has been colored red using Internal CSS. If I had to keep listing things I don't know how to do yet, changing the size of the text (header or paragraph) is definitely one of them. Additionally, the text of the body has been alligned to the center using External CSS.
